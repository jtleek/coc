## Leek Group Code of Conduct

The Leek Group is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any work event, including group meetings, conferences, talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. This code of conduct applies to all group members, including leadership, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, Slack channels, Basecamp, and Twitter.

Leek group members violating these rules will be referred to the Title IX coordinator  at JHU and will no longer be part of the group. 

## All Leek Group members agree to:

__Be considerate__ in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of other members.
__Be respectful__ Disagreements happen, but do not require poor behavior or poor manners. Frustration is inevitable, but it should never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Leek Group members should be respectful with other members in the group as well as members outside of the Leek Group.
__Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech__ Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert Jeff Leek or any of the other participating faculty members in the Leek group (Margaret Taub, Leah Jager, Kai Kammers, or Andrew Jaffe)
__Take care of each other__ Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert XXXX if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
